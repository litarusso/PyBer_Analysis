Chart 1: The Final Chart


### Results
#### The results of this analysis show us:
- Urban and suburban city types' fares are increasing in four months, but rural's fares are nearly the same.
- The most total rides and fares amount are in urban cities; however, the average fare per ride and driver is less than the others.
#### The final chart shows us: 
- The urban city drivers earn less money than the other city types' drivers. 
- Rural cities' fares are less than the others. 
- At the end of March, all the fares are increasing. 
### Summary
- They have to increase the average fare per ride and driver of the rural city type,
- They have to increase the income of the drivers in the urban city type.
- They have to reconsider the fare prices of the suburbs.
