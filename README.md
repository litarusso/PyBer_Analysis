# PyBer Challenge
### Overview of The Analysis
## The Purpose 
This analysis aims to merge and visualize two big data about the rides, drivers, fares and dates of urban, suburban, and rural city types.
## The Task
My task was to summarize the data Pyber to visualize it for the customer, and at the end, I had to create a multiple-line plot that shows the total weekly fares for each type of city from January to April.Â¶
### Results
#### The results of this analysis show us:
- Urban and suburban city types' fares are increasing in four months, but rural's fares are nearly the same.
- The most total rides and fares amount are in urban cities; however, the average fare per ride and driver is less than the others.
#### The final chart shows us: 
- The urban city drivers earn less money than the other city types' drivers. 
- Rural cities' fares are less than the others. 
- At the end of March, all the fares are increasing. 
### Summary
- They have to increase the average fare per ride and driver of the rural city type,
- They have to increase the income of the drivers in the urban city type.
- They have to reconsider the fare prices of the suburbs.
